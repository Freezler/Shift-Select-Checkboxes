## SHIFT SELECT CHECKBOXES

# This project demonstrates how to implement a common email client feature: selecting multiple checkboxes by holding the Shift key

When a user clicks a checkbox, holds Shift, and then clicks another checkbox a few rows down, all the checkboxes in between should be checked.
